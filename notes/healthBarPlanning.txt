ready:
    grunt spawns
    main connects signals from grunt to hudLayer
    also sets hard reference of grunt's healthBarPosition node in hudLayer (probably won't change this later)

process:
    hudLayer constantly updates healthBar position in viewport to align with healthBarPosition node (in grunt instance) (healthBarPosition.get_position) (use camera unproject function)

grunt emits signal: health updated

hudLayer takes this signal and updates healthBar to sync with health change
