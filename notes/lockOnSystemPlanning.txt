lockOn preview cursor (like in botw) (currently on crosshair as TEST)
    get all enemies from main
    get camera from main

    auto target for quick key press
    manual target for hold key
    auto target:
        get nearest enemy to player in view of the camera
            is behind camera
            array of all enemies (main has that array)
            compare magnitude of transforms
                for enemy in array:
                    if larger:
                        temp = enemy
                        return temp

press key
lock on
cursor turns yellow (or whatever color I want)
camera focuses on locked on enemy
stores enemy in variable

previous enemy disengages player while recently attacked enemy engages with player (might change to a different system for consistency purposes) (player might accidentally attack an enemy)
honor system determines player credibility while attacking
    high honor makes enemies predictable and less likely to interrupt a one-on-one
    low honor encourages enemies to try and interrupt (since the player did so) (but some enemies are more likely to do so)
honor lost by attacking enemies in the strafing (non engagement) state
honor gained by ??? (over time?) (something else?)
