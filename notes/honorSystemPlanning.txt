previous enemy disengages player while recently attacked enemy engages with player (might change to a different system for consistency purposes) (player might accidentally attack an enemy)

honor system determines player credibility while attacking
    high honor makes enemies predictable and less likely to interrupt a one-on-one
    low honor encourages enemies to try and interrupt (since the player did so) (but some enemies are more likely to do so)

honor lost by attacking enemies in the strafing (non engagement) state

honor gained by ??? (over time?) (something else?)

MAYBE ADD HONOR SYSTEM VERY LATE IN DEVELOPMENT
