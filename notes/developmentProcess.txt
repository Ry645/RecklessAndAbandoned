NO I FRAMES
ONLY PARRY FRAMES AND BLOCKING


strafing:
	like Peroxide circle around player when fighting npcs but the player actually earns the kill 
	strafe in circle around player

player attacks wildly and quickly
early game enemies attack predictably and methodically, telegraphed attacks
end game eneimes attack like the player

blockbreaker attacks have a red flash and distinct sound (kinda like mettaton ex summon)
	early game enemies ONLY use this attack at the end of a string OR on its own, ALWAYS gives player ample time to recover
	end game eneimes do whatever the fuck they want idk

blocking
	player can sheathe weapon to block with hands
	ATTACKING AND SKILLS HAVE NO EFFECT (includes healing and buffs)
	same parry effects, but...
	hand blocking negates ALL damage
	sword blocking only halves damage
	
	blockbreakers can only break regular sword blocks
	
	tutorial starts with no weapon so the player can learn


Gist:
    only melee Fighting game, inspired by Pilgrammed, but with constant parrying
    1v1 fighting system with communicative ai


Development Process:
    tutorial
        fight singular grunt
            grunt ai
                circle aorund player
                behavior tree
            hurtboxes
                area3d
                maybe add in damage type resource
            make models and anmimations in blender
            sync up blender anmimations with script
            make sure everything is in its own component for resusablity
            
        no sword
            block with reklite branded gauntlets
            gauntlets block 100% of damage and negates blockbreakers
            best for practice
    try to study rhythm games for accurate inputs
    progression system
        make it like Terraria
        disarm enemies for rare swords for crafting new gear
        enemies show accessories
    
    10 levels
    journal to keep info when go back in 3 years
    stone islands in sky
